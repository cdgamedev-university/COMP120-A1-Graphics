# comp120-tinkering-graphics

This code has been written as part of the Tinkering Graphics tasks in the COMP120 module at Falmouth University. 
This is a social Media Filter that could be integrated into any social media app.


 We have chosen to use the GNU LGPLv3 (GNU Lesser General Public License version 3) for our program as we intend it
 to be used by social media apps as a 3rd party add on filter. We wanted the source code of the original app to stay open
 and free software which GPL3 provides, However, we were concerned about how social media companies would not be willing to 
 use our filter because of this licences strict "copy left" licensing. This is when we discovered the LGPL3 license that allows
 integration and does not have such a strong copy left licensing agreement. This makes the filter we have created more acessable
 to social media companies and encourages open and free software distribution.
